    <h3>Fresh salmon cake</h3>
    <p>Every once in a while I like to use fresh salmon. Salmon is one of those products, like chicken,
    <br> that's very easy to get into a rut with. People generally find a few recipes that work for them, and just stay with those,<br> 
    but this fairly simple preparation should be easy to add to anyone's rotation. Serve with lemon wedge and remoulade sauce. <br></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced red bell pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced celery</li>
        <li>1 ¼ pounds fresh wild salmon, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>¼ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 pinch seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Step 1</strong> <br> Heat extra virgin olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. 
            Cook and stir onion, red <br>pepper, celery, and a pinch of salt  
           in hot oil until onion is soft and translucent,<br> about 5 minutes.  
           Add capers; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. <br>
            Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. <br></li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong> <br>Stir salmon, onion mixture, mayonnaise, 
             1/4 cup bread crumbs, garlic, mustard,<br> cayenne, seafood seasoning, salt, 
             and ground black pepper together in a bowl<br> until well-mixed. 
             Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firmed<br> and chilled, 1 to 2 hours. <br></li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong> <br> Form salmon mixture into four 1-inch thick patties; sprinkle remaining panko <br> bread crumbs over each patty. <br></li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong> <br> Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-heat. Cook patties in hot oil until golden <br> and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. <br></li>
    </ol>
