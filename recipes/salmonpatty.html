    <h3>Fresh salmon cake</h3>
    <p>Every once in a while I like to use fresh salmon. Salmon is one of those products, like chicken,
    <br> that's very easy to get into a rut with. People generally find a few recipes that work for them, and just stay with those,<br> 
    but this fairly simple preparation should be easy to add to anyone's rotation. Serve with lemon wedge and remoulade sauce. <br></p>
