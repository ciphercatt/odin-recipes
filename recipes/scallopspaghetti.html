    <h3>Fresh creamy Bay Scallop Spaghetti</h3>
    <p> <br> This scallop pasta dinner with a creamy sauce is fast and easy. I cook the <br>
         scallops a bit longer than many chefs, but that gives the dish more flavor <br>
          and they're still tender and moist. I think you'll agree, the sherry sauce benefits <br>
           significantly from the longer cook time. <br></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked thick spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pound bay scallops</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼2 teaspoons grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>⅓ cup dry sherry</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Step 1</strong> <br> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling <br>
             water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes <br>
              or 1 minute less than directed on the package. <br></li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong> <br>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. When oil just starts to <br>
             smoke, add scallops and move them into a single layer. Let sear on high for <br>
              about 1 minute. Toss to turn.<br></li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong> <br> Pour in cream. When mixture begins to simmer, reduce heat to medium-low. <br> Add salt, pepper, and lemon juice. <br></li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong> <br> Drain pasta. Transfer to skillet with scallops; bring to a simmer. Add 1/2 of the <br>
             chopped parsley. Cook until pasta is heated through and tender, about 1 <br>
              minute. <br></li>
    </ol>
